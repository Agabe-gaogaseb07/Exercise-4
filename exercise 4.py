#First prompts to enter a value.
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")

#Now as a = a, the value remains on the same variable.
#But if you switch the variables ("a = " + a) to ("a = " + b), it will switch the value on variable (a) to the value on variable (b).
print("a = " + a)
print("b = " + b)

#Like illustrated below with this in the second code!!

#This print function is my underlining.
print("/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n/n")

#This is the second implementatation of the code.
print("a = " + b)
print("b = " + a)
